      <p>My name is Amalia Nurlita, but you can just call me Amal.
        I am a bachelor's degree focused on Economics from Universitas Airlangga.
        During my college year, I was an active student and had experiences that I will show you.
        Now, I'm focusing on learning HTML and CSS with Progate and Glints Academy.
       I hope that I can be a Front Web Developer based on knowledge that I got from Progate and Glints Academy.</p>

      <p>  One more time about me! In my spare time, I enjoy painting and do art stuff but I can only draw some easy pictures.
        For me, painting the best way to express myself and release tension. Comunication throught color and line is the most sincere.
